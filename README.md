### Notes
**Objectives Learned :**
* Creating a Network Request to an API:
  * Copying a chunk of code... should try to understand better what that chunk  actually means
* Creating UITableViews: 
  * Still don't understand the purpose of UITableViewDataSource and UITableViewDelegate.
* Creating custom UITableCells:
  * Pretty straight forward by creating a new Cocoa Touch Class.
* Adding Pods to the project and using AlmaofireImage
